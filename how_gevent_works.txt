python library for asyncio

green threads

CPython (GIL) da

twisted works but the code is very complicated

green threads
OS does not ceate or manage them
OS does not schedule or preempt
Because of these 2 they are very light weight. it can process 20000 connection concurrents.

gevent uses green threads
g = gevent.Greenlet(download_photos, user)
g.start()

.switch() pauses the a routine and resumes if called again from where it left of.

greenlet library is written in C. it works by manipulating the c stack.

machine stack - that is where greenlet resides. python runs on interpreter stack

and python sCPython

stack slicing - if a() switches to b() after b completes and if a.switch() is called it copies the stack to a heap and copies it back
into the c stack which the python stack does not know

 minus
  - no parallism
   - non-cooperate code will block the entire process
    - monkey patching may have confusing.. the order of imports matter.
