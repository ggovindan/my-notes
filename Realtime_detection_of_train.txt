OpenCV
    package for image processing.
    great for realtime application


idenfity if somehting is moving
cmawer.githuhb.io/trainspotting

cvtColor()
GaussianBlur()

cv2.absDiff() //gives idea of what changed between frames

identify if it is a train

realtime deployment
-------------
picamera package was used in raspberry pi

PiCamera is a package available in raspberry pi. Picamera is easy to change background and contrast
picamera package can do live analysis so that we dont have to save the video file.

parameters to consider
-------
1. resolution + K
change the k proportionality with the resolution. this has to be used with GaussianBlur Algo.

2. Resolution + area_thresh
This is needed to identify two point a, b and identify if an object is moving left or right

3. frame rate + alpha
how to weigh in each frame. 

4. frame rate + history length

5. frame rate limitation
requires one frame with train present in only one ROI.
IF you need to identify the movement faster then more frame rate is needed.

6. what if light changes
Background subtraction
    frame differencing
        good for indoors
        very fast computationally
    Alternative: adaptive background subtraction
